# GoodVotes
A scientifically approved voting platform for complex preferences.

## Run
Simply run the script "run.sh" in Application/Server

## Use
The Server will listen on port 5000. An example election is preloaded (search for "Goodmans Pipes and Tubes"), but you can create elections as you like. The evaluation token for the "Goodmans Pipes and Tubes" election is "b074dacd".

# Please Note:
This application is only tested with the Chrome browser family. In particular, we are currently working on a fix for Firefox. It seems that firefox is not supporting our drag-and-drop functions.
